# Everyday Tasks

A **task management app** built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Firebase**.  
Inspired by **Todoist**, it lets you create, organize, and manage tasks with rich parameters and a clean, modern UI.

- 📝 **Rich task parameters** — each task can include:
  - Date & deadline
  - Priority
  - Reminders
  - Tags
  - Executor
  - Location
- 📌 **Flexible parameter management** — easily add or remove parameters for each task
- 🎨 **Modern Compose UI** — inspired by Todoist but with a custom design
- ⚡ **Instant preview** of parameters inside a task

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose** — declarative Android UI
- **Firebase Firestore** — cloud database for task storage
- **Material3** — clean, modern components
- **Coroutines & Flow** — for async data handling

## 💡 Inspiration
This project is heavily inspired by [**Todoist**](https://todoist.com),  
but built as a personal experiment to learn:
- How to design **custom parameter-based tasks**
- Using **Compose for dynamic layouts**
- **Firebase sync** with real-world apps

## 🚀 Future Plans
- [ ] Task search & filtering  
- [ ] Offline-first mode with local caching  
- [ ] Notifications for reminders
